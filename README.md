Hello!

I've staarted to re-learn web development as I used to do it in highschool. 
This past year I had some medical issues tht coincided with losing my job 
because of having a baby and a stroke shortly afterwards. So I ned to be able
to work in a sterile environment and I like doing this so it seems cool. I'm a 
successful fine artist and other web dev friends want me to catch back up so I 
can get started on designing.
