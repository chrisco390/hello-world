Hello!

I've started to re-learn web development as I used to do it in highschool. 
This past year I had some medical issues that started with losing my job 
because of having a baby and then had a stroke shortly afterwards, I'm in 
my early 30's. So I need to be able to work in a sterile environment and 
I like doing this so it seems cool. I'm a successful fine artist and my
web dev friends want me to catch back up so I can get started on designing.
